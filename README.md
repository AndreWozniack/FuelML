# FuelML

A simple project to implement a model that uses Machine Learning with Linear regression to predict your car's fuel consumption and calculate the amount spent.

In the future, the App will have a direct connection to the car using an OBD-II connector to provide real-time information to analyze consumption over a period of time and predict fuel consumption in real time and for future days.
